                <p><b>Dumpling and Beef Stew</b>A good Beef Stew with Dumplings is one of those classic recipes that everyone should have in their familyâ€™s recipe collection! This Beef Stew with Dumplings starts out like most other beef stew recipes: tender chunks of beef, carrots, potatoes and onions layered in a thick gravy.  But what really makes this special is the addition of some red wine, tomato paste, thyme and other seasonings that you might not expect that really enhance the flavors of the meat and vegetables.</p>
