                <p><b>Sticky Walkie Talkies</b> one of the most popular South African street food dishes
                    
                chicken feet are mainly eaten in townships in all nine provinces, where they are known as "walkie talkies", "runaways" and "chicken dust". The feet are submerged in hot water, so the outer layer of the skin can be removed by peeling it off, and then covered in seasonings and grilled. The name "chicken dust" derives from the dust chickens create when scratching the ground with their feet. They are often eaten as a snack.</p>
